# Tasks for Loop

Items to add into Loop for autonomous agent work once this repo is connected.

---

- [ ] Investigate switching `apps/cli` from `@inquirer/prompts` to `@clack/prompts` for consistency with `packages/loop-connect` and better default styling
- [ ] Does the MCP use our SDK? If not, should it?
- [ ] Can we make the UI show real-time updates? Would that be better than polling?
