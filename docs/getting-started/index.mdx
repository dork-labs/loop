# Getting Started

Loop is the **autonomous improvement engine** — an open-source data layer and prompt engine that collects signals, organizes work into issues, and tells AI agents exactly what to do next. There is no AI inside Loop. It is a fully deterministic system that any agent can pull work from over HTTP.

<Callout title="New to Loop?" type="info">
  If this is your first time, start with the **Quickstart** below. You will go from zero to a dispatched
  issue in under five minutes.

### Connect an AI Agent

If you are building an autonomous agent workflow and want your agent to pull tasks from Loop, pick the integration surface that fits your setup.

### Build with the SDK or CLI

## Prerequisites

Before running Loop locally, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 20+** installed
- **Docker** installed and running (for local PostgreSQL)
- **pnpm** (install via `npm install -g pnpm` or see [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/installation))

For production deployments, you will need a [Neon](https://neon.tech) PostgreSQL database. For local development, Loop provides a Docker Compose configuration that runs PostgreSQL automatically.
