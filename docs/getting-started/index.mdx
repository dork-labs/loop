# Getting Started

Loop is the **Autonomous Improvement Engine** — an open-source data layer and prompt engine that collects signals, organizes work into issues, and tells AI agents exactly what to do next. It closes the feedback loop for AI-powered development by turning raw data (errors, metrics, user feedback) into prioritized, actionable work items.

## What makes Loop different

Loop is fully deterministic. It makes **zero LLM calls** — no embeddings, no generation, no AI inside the engine itself. Instead, Loop structures work so that *any* AI agent can read a hydrated prompt and take action. Quality improves automatically when better models read Loop's prompts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 20+** installed
- **PostgreSQL** database ([Neon](https://neon.tech) serverless recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## What you will learn

This section walks you through everything you need to start using Loop:

- [**Quickstart**](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) — Go from zero to your first dispatched issue in 5 minutes. Clone the repo, start the API, ingest a signal, and see a hydrated prompt.
- [**Authentication**](/docs/getting-started/authentication) — Understand how to authenticate API requests with Bearer tokens and how webhook providers verify their payloads.
