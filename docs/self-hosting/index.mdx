# Self-Hosting

Loop is fully open source and designed to be self-hosted. You can deploy it on Vercel with zero configuration, run it on any Node.js server, or containerize it for your own infrastructure.

## Architecture

A Loop deployment consists of three components:

- **API server** (`@loop/api`) -- A Hono TypeScript API that handles all data operations, signal ingestion, and prompt dispatch. Runs as Vercel Functions in production or as a standalone Node.js process.
- **Dashboard** (`@loop/app`) -- A React 19 SPA that provides a visual interface for managing issues, viewing activity, and monitoring prompt health. Deployed as static files.
- **Marketing site** (`@loop/web`) -- A Next.js site with Fumadocs for documentation. Optional for self-hosting.

The only external dependency is a **PostgreSQL database**. Loop recommends [Neon](https://neon.tech) for serverless PostgreSQL, but any PostgreSQL 15+ instance works.

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Node.js     | 20+                         |
| PostgreSQL  | 15+                         |
| npm         | 10+ (ships with Node.js 20) |

## Deployment Options

Loop supports two deployment paths:

- [**Vercel**](/docs/self-hosting/deployment#vercel-deployment) (recommended) -- Import the monorepo, configure environment variables, and deploy. Hono auto-detects the Vercel Functions runtime.
- [**Manual**](/docs/self-hosting/deployment#manual-deployment) -- Build the apps locally and run the API as a Node.js process. Serve the dashboard as static files behind any web server.

## Next Steps

- [**Environment Variables**](/docs/self-hosting/environment) -- Complete reference for all configuration variables across the API and dashboard.
- [**Deployment Guide**](/docs/self-hosting/deployment) -- Step-by-step instructions for Vercel and manual deployments.
