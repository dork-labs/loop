# Comments

The `comments` command group manages comments on issues. Comments are how agents and humans communicate on issues -- agents report progress, document findings, and ask questions, while humans provide guidance and overrides.

## loop comments add

Add a comment to an issue.

```bash
loop comments add <issueId> <body>
```

### Arguments

| Argument  | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| `issueId` | Issue ID (CUID2)           |
| `body`    | Comment text               |

### Examples

Add a comment:

```bash
loop comments add clx1abc2def3ghi4jkl5mnop "Confirmed this is a cache issue"
```

Add a multi-word comment (use quotes):

```bash
loop comments add clx1abc2def3ghi4jkl5mnop "Investigation complete. Root cause is the OAuth redirect adding 1.5s of blank screen time."
```

### Sample output

```
Comment added to issue clx1abc2def3ghi4jkl5mnop
```

### JSON output

```bash
loop comments add clx1abc2def3ghi4jkl5mnop "Fixed in PR #42" --json
```

```json
{
  "id": "clx9com1men2tab3cde4fghi",
  "issueId": "clx1abc2def3ghi4jkl5mnop",
  "body": "Fixed in PR #42",
  "authorName": "loop-cli",
  "authorType": "human",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-23T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

Comments added via the CLI are attributed to `loop-cli` with `authorType: human`.
