# Status

The `status` command shows a system health overview, including issue counts by status and type, dispatch queue metrics, and goal progress.

## looped status

```bash
looped status
```

### Sample output

```
  Loop System Status

  Issues
    Total: 42

    By Status:
      triage        3
      todo          8
      backlog       15
      in_progress   2
      done          12
      canceled      2

    By Type:
      signal        10
      hypothesis    5
      plan          7
      task          18
      monitor       2

  Dispatch
    Queue depth:     8
    Active:          2
    Done (24h):      5

  Goals
    Total:           3
    Active:          2
    Achieved:        1
```

### JSON output

Use `--json` to get the raw metrics as JSON, suitable for monitoring scripts and dashboards:

```bash
looped status --json
```

```json
{
  "issues": {
    "total": 42,
    "byStatus": {
      "triage": 3,
      "todo": 8,
      "backlog": 15,
      "in_progress": 2,
      "done": 12,
      "canceled": 2
    },
    "byType": {
      "signal": 10,
      "hypothesis": 5,
      "plan": 7,
      "task": 18,
      "monitor": 2
    }
  },
  "goals": {
    "total": 3,
    "active": 2,
    "achieved": 1
  },
  "dispatch": {
    "queueDepth": 8,
    "activeCount": 2,
    "completedLast24h": 5
  }
}
```

### Use in monitoring

The `status` command works well for periodic health checks in scripts:

```bash
# Quick health check in CI
looped status --json | jq '.dispatch.queueDepth'

# Alert if queue depth exceeds threshold
DEPTH=$(looped status --json | jq '.dispatch.queueDepth')
if [ "$DEPTH" -gt 20 ]; then
  echo "Warning: dispatch queue depth is $DEPTH"
fi
```
