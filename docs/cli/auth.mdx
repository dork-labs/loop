# Auth

The `auth` command group manages authentication with the Loop API. It provides interactive login, credential clearing, and status checking.

## loop auth login

Interactively authenticate with the Loop API. Prompts for the API URL and API key, validates the credentials against the server, and saves them to the config file.

```bash
loop auth login
```

### Interactive prompts

| Prompt       | Default                  | Description                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Loop API URL | `http://localhost:5667`  | API base URL                     |
| API key      | none                     | Your Loop API key (starts with `loop_`) |

The command validates the credentials by making a test request to the API. If validation fails, the credentials are not saved.

### Example session

```
$ loop auth login
? Loop API URL: https://api.looped.me
? API key (starts with loop_): ****
✔ Authenticated successfully
Config saved to ~/.loop/config.json
```

### Error output

```
$ loop auth login
? Loop API URL: https://api.looped.me
? API key (starts with loop_): ****
✖ Authentication failed. Check your API key and URL.
```

## loop auth logout

Clear stored credentials from the config file.

```bash
loop auth logout
```

### Sample output

```
Logged out. Credentials cleared.
```

---

## loop auth status

Show the current authentication state, including the configured URL and a masked version of the API key.

```bash
loop auth status
```

### Sample output (authenticated)

```
Authenticated
  URL:   https://api.looped.me
  Token: loop_****...abcd
```

### Sample output (not authenticated)

```
Not authenticated. Run: loop auth login
```

---

## Typical authentication workflow

```bash
# 1. Log in interactively
loop auth login

# 2. Verify authentication state
loop auth status

# 3. Start using the CLI
loop issues list

# 4. When done, clear credentials
loop auth logout
```

## Configuration storage

Credentials are stored in `~/.loop/config.json` with restricted file permissions (`0600`). The config file is also used by `loop config set` and `loop config get`. See the [CLI Reference](/docs/cli) for details on configuration resolution order.
