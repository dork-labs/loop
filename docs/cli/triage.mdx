# Triage

The `triage` command group lets you view the triage queue and act on pending issues. Issues enter triage when signals are ingested, and must be accepted or declined before they enter the work pipeline.

## looped triage

List all issues with `triage` status.

```bash
looped triage
```

### Sample output

## looped triage accept

Accept a triage issue into the backlog. This sets the issue status to `backlog`.

```bash
looped triage accept <id>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description      |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| `id`     | Issue ID (CUID2) |

### Example

```bash
looped triage accept clx8iss2uea3bcd4efg5hijk
```

### Sample output

```
Issue clx8iss2uea3bcd4efg5hijk accepted into backlog
```

---

## looped triage decline

Decline a triage issue by setting its status to `canceled`. An optional reason can be provided, which is saved as a comment on the issue.

```bash
looped triage decline <id> [reason]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`     | Issue ID (CUID2)                                   |
| `reason` | Optional reason for declining (saved as a comment) |

### Examples

Decline without a reason:

```bash
looped triage decline clx8iss2uea3bcd4efg5hijk
```

Decline with a reason:

```bash
looped triage decline clx8iss2uea3bcd4efg5hijk "Duplicate of issue #32"
```

### Sample output

```
Issue clx8iss2uea3bcd4efg5hijk declined
```

When a reason is provided, a comment is posted on the issue with `authorName: looped-cli` before the issue is marked as declined. If the comment fails to save, a warning is printed but the decline still succeeds.

## Typical triage workflow

```bash
# 1. Check the triage queue
looped triage

# 2. Inspect a specific issue
looped show clx8iss2uea3bcd4efg5hijk

# 3. Accept it into the backlog
looped triage accept clx8iss2uea3bcd4efg5hijk

# Or decline with a reason
looped triage decline clx9xyz... "Not actionable — transient network blip"
```
