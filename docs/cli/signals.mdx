# Signals

The `signal` command submits a manual signal to Loop. A signal represents raw data from an external source (error, metric, user feedback). When submitted, Loop creates both a Signal record and a linked triage Issue automatically.

## looped signal

```bash
looped signal <message> [options]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `message` | Signal message text (required) |

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--source <s>` | `manual` | Signal source identifier |
| `--severity <sev>` | `medium` | Severity level: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| `--project <id>` | none | Project ID to associate with |

### Examples

Submit a basic signal:

```bash
looped signal "Checkout error rate spike: 5.2% to 12.1%"
```

Submit a high-severity signal:

```bash
looped signal "Database connection pool exhausted" --severity high
```

Submit with a custom source and project:

```bash
looped signal "Memory usage exceeding 90% threshold" \
  --source monitoring \
  --severity critical \
  --project clx1abc2def3ghi4jkl5mnop
```

Use in a CI pipeline with environment variables:

```bash
LOOP_API_URL=https://api.looped.me \
LOOP_API_TOKEN=tok_... \
looped signal --severity high "Deploy failed: exit code 1"
```

Output as JSON:

```bash
looped signal "Test failure in auth module" --json
```

### Sample output

```
Signal created: clx7sig1nal2abc3def4ghij
Linked issue: #46 Checkout error rate spike: 5.2% to 12.1%
```

### JSON output

When using `--json`, the full response is printed:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "signal": {
      "id": "clx7sig1nal2abc3def4ghij",
      "source": "manual",
      "type": "manual-signal",
      "severity": "medium",
      "payload": {
        "message": "Checkout error rate spike: 5.2% to 12.1%"
      },
      "issueId": "clx8iss2uea3bcd4efg5hijk",
      "createdAt": "2026-02-20T10:30:00.000Z"
    },
    "issue": {
      "id": "clx8iss2uea3bcd4efg5hijk",
      "number": 46,
      "title": "Checkout error rate spike: 5.2% to 12.1%",
      "type": "signal",
      "status": "triage",
      "priority": 3
    }
  }
}
```

### How signals work

When you submit a signal, the API:

1. Creates a **Signal** record with the source, severity, and payload
2. Creates a linked **Issue** with `type: signal` and `status: triage`
3. Returns both the signal and the issue

The new issue appears in the triage queue, where it can be reviewed with [`looped triage`](/docs/cli/triage).
