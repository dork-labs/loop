# Dashboard

The `dashboard` command shows a system health overview, including issue counts by status and type, dispatch queue metrics, and goal progress. This is the same data available in the web dashboard, accessible from the terminal.

## loop dashboard

```bash
loop dashboard
```

### Sample output

```
  Loop System Status

  Issues
    Total: 42

    By Status:
      triage        3
      todo          8
      backlog       15
      in_progress   2
      done          12
      canceled      2

    By Type:
      signal        10
      hypothesis    5
      plan          7
      task          18
      monitor       2

  Dispatch
    Queue depth:     8
    Active:          2
    Done (24h):      5

  Goals
    Total:           3
    Active:          2
    Achieved:        1
```

### JSON output

Use `--json` to get the raw metrics as JSON, suitable for monitoring scripts and dashboards:

```bash
loop dashboard --json
```

```json
{
  "issues": {
    "total": 42,
    "byStatus": {
      "triage": 3,
      "todo": 8,
      "backlog": 15,
      "in_progress": 2,
      "done": 12,
      "canceled": 2
    },
    "byType": {
      "signal": 10,
      "hypothesis": 5,
      "plan": 7,
      "task": 18,
      "monitor": 2
    }
  },
  "goals": {
    "total": 3,
    "active": 2,
    "achieved": 1
  },
  "dispatch": {
    "queueDepth": 8,
    "activeCount": 2,
    "completedLast24h": 5
  }
}
```

### Plain output

Use `--plain` for tab-separated values, useful for piping to other tools:

```bash
loop dashboard --plain
```

```
issues_total	42
queue_depth	8
active	2
done_24h	5
goals_total	3
goals_achieved	1
```

| Issues   | By Type     | Breakdown across issue types (signal, hypothesis, plan, task, monitor) |
| Dispatch | Queue depth | Number of issues waiting in the dispatch queue                         |
| Dispatch | Active      | Issues currently being worked on (`in_progress`)                       |

### Use in monitoring

The `dashboard` command works well for periodic health checks in scripts:

```bash
# Quick health check in CI
loop dashboard --json | jq '.dispatch.queueDepth'

# Alert if queue depth exceeds threshold
DEPTH=$(loop dashboard --json | jq '.dispatch.queueDepth')
if [ "$DEPTH" -gt 20 ]; then
  echo "Warning: dispatch queue depth is $DEPTH"
fi
```
