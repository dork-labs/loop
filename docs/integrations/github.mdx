# GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration receives webhook events and creates signals in Loop. Security advisories, code scanning alerts, pull requests, issues, and pushes are all supported.

## Endpoint

```
POST /api/signals/github
```

## Authentication

GitHub signs every webhook delivery with an **HMAC-SHA256** signature. Loop verifies this signature before processing any payload.

- **Header:** `X-Hub-Signature-256`
- **Format:** `sha256=<hex-digest>`
- **Algorithm:** HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body using `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- **Comparison:** Timing-safe (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`) to prevent timing attacks

If the header is missing or the signature does not match, Loop responds with `401`.

## Severity Mapping

Loop maps GitHub event types to severity levels:

| GitHub Event | Severity |
|---|---|
| `security_advisory` | `critical` |
| `code_scanning_alert` | `critical` |
| `dependabot_alert` | `high` |
| `issues` | `medium` |
| `pull_request` | `low` |
| `push` | `low` |
| `issue_comment` | `low` |
| Other events | `medium` (default) |

## What Gets Created

Each webhook delivery creates:

- A **signal** record with `source: "github"`, the event type, severity, and full payload.
- A linked **issue** with type `signal`, status `triage`, and a title like `GitHub: push on acme/repo by octocat`.

The issue title includes the event type, repository full name, and the actor's login.

## Setup

<Steps>

<Step>
### Generate a webhook secret

Create a random secret string. Use a cryptographically secure method:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Save this value -- you will need it for both GitHub and your Loop environment.
</Step>

<Step>
### Set the environment variable

Add the secret to your Loop API environment:

```bash
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here
```

This variable must be available to the Loop API process at runtime.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure the webhook in GitHub

1. Go to your repository (or organization) **Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook**.
2. Set **Payload URL** to your Loop endpoint:
   ```
   https://your-loop-api.example.com/api/signals/github
   ```
3. Set **Content type** to `application/json`.
4. Set **Secret** to the same value you used for `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
5. Choose which events to send. Recommended: **Send me everything** or select specific events like `push`, `pull_request`, `issues`, `security_advisory`, `code_scanning_alert`, and `dependabot_alert`.
6. Ensure **Active** is checked and click **Add webhook**.
</Step>

<Step>
### Verify the connection

GitHub sends a `ping` event when the webhook is first created. Check your Loop instance for a new signal with source `github`. You can also use the GitHub webhook **Recent Deliveries** tab to confirm a `2xx` response.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Example Payload

The full GitHub webhook payload is stored in the signal's `payload` field and the issue's `signalPayload` field. Loop reads the following fields:

- `repository.full_name` -- used in the issue title
- `sender.login` -- used in the issue title
- `action` -- combined with the event type for the signal's `sourceId`
- `X-GitHub-Event` header -- determines the event type and severity
