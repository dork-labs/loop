# Integrations

Loop receives signals from external tools through **webhook endpoints**. Each integration listens for provider-specific events, verifies authenticity, and automatically creates a signal and linked issue in your Loop instance.

## Supported Providers

| Provider                              | Endpoint                    | Auth Method                           | Signal Types                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [GitHub](/docs/integrations/github)   | `POST /api/signals/github`  | HMAC-SHA256 (`X-Hub-Signature-256`)   | Push, PR, issues, security alerts, Dependabot |
| [Sentry](/docs/integrations/sentry)   | `POST /api/signals/sentry`  | HMAC-SHA256 (`Sentry-Hook-Signature`) | Errors, warnings, fatal crashes               |
| [PostHog](/docs/integrations/posthog) | `POST /api/signals/posthog` | Shared secret (`X-PostHog-Secret`)    | Metric change alerts                          |

## How It Works

Every webhook integration follows the same pattern:

1. **Receive** -- Loop receives an HTTP POST from the provider.
2. **Verify** -- The request signature or secret is checked against your configured environment variable. Invalid requests are rejected with `401`.
3. **Map** -- The payload is mapped to a severity level (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`) using provider-specific logic.
4. **Create** -- A `signal` record and a linked `issue` (type `signal`, status `triage`) are created atomically in a database transaction.

The created issue inherits a priority derived from the severity mapping:

| Severity   | Priority   |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| `critical` | 1 (urgent) |
| `high`     | 2          |
| `medium`   | 3          |
| `low`      | 4          |

## Security

All webhook endpoints use **timing-safe comparison** (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`) to prevent timing attacks when verifying signatures or secrets. If the corresponding environment variable is not set, the endpoint returns `500` rather than silently accepting unverified requests.

Webhook endpoints use provider-specific authentication and are **not** behind the standard `Authorization: Bearer` API key middleware.

## Agent Integration

Looking to connect an AI agent to Loop rather than an external service? See the [Agent Integration](/docs/agents) guides for per-agent setup instructions covering Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenHands, and custom agents. You can also learn how to [build a polling loop](/docs/guides/agent-polling-loop) for autonomous task execution.
