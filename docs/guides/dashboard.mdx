# Dashboard

The Loop dashboard is a dark-mode SPA built with React and TanStack Router. It gives you a real-time view of your issues, activity feed, goals, and prompt health from a single interface. The sidebar provides navigation between views and collapses on mobile into a hamburger menu.

## Issue List

The default view when you open the dashboard. It shows all issues in a filterable, paginated data table.

### Filters

Use the filter bar above the table to narrow results by:

- **Status** — `backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`, `done`, `canceled`
- **Type** — `signal`, `hypothesis`, `plan`, `task`, `monitor`
- **Project** — scope to a specific project
- **Label** — filter by any label applied to issues
- **Priority** — `0` (none) through `4` (low), `3` (medium), `2` (high), `1` (urgent)

Filters are reflected in the URL query string, so you can bookmark or share filtered views.

### Pagination

The table defaults to 50 items per page. Page and limit are controlled via query parameters (`?page=1&limit=50`).

## Issue Detail

Click any issue in the list to open its detail view. The layout uses a two-column grid on large screens: main content on the left, metadata sidebar on the right.

### Main content

- **Header** — issue number, title, type badge, and status
- **Description** — rendered as Markdown
- **Signal data** — for `signal`-type issues, displays the source and raw payload
- **Hypothesis data** — for `hypothesis`-type issues, shows the statement, confidence score, and validation criteria
- **Agent results** — agent summary, linked commits, and pull requests (when an agent has worked the issue)
- **Child issues** — sub-issues created under this parent
- **Comments** — threaded discussion attached to the issue

### Sidebar

- **Metadata** — status, priority, type, project, creation date, and labels
- **Relations** — `blocks` and `blocked_by` links to other issues

## Activity Timeline

The Activity view shows signal chains — the full lifecycle from an incoming signal through the issues it created. Each chain groups a signal with its downstream issues so you can trace how raw data turned into work.

When the timeline is empty, the dashboard displays a placeholder indicating the loop is waiting for signals.

## Goals

The Goals view displays all defined goals in a two-column card grid. Each goal card shows:

- **Title** — the goal name
- **Progress** — current value vs. target value with units (e.g., `72ms / 50ms`)
- **Status** — `active`, `completed`, or `paused`

Goals are tied to projects and influence issue prioritization. Issues in a project with an active goal receive a scoring bonus during dispatch.

## Prompt Health

The Prompt Health view lists every prompt template registered in the system. Each card surfaces:

- **Template name and slug** — identifies the template
- **Active version** — which version is currently being dispatched
- **Usage count** — how many times the active version has been used
- **Review scores** — EWMA-weighted averages for clarity, completeness, and relevance (1-5 scale)
- **Overall score** — combined health metric

Templates appear here automatically when the dispatch engine begins using them. If no templates exist yet, the view shows a placeholder.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The dashboard supports keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation. Press `?` at any time to open the shortcuts help dialog.

| Shortcut           | Action                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `g` then `i`       | Go to Issues                 |
| `g` then `a`       | Go to Activity               |
| `g` then `g`       | Go to Goals                  |
| `g` then `p`       | Go to Prompts                |
| `Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B` | Toggle sidebar               |
| `?`                | Open keyboard shortcuts help |

<Callout type="info">
  Navigation shortcuts use a two-key sequence: press `g` first, then the second key. The sidebar
  toggle uses the platform modifier key — `Cmd` on macOS, `Ctrl` on Windows and Linux.
