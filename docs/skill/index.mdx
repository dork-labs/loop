# Agent Skill

The Loop agent skill (`@dork-labs/loop`) is a content-only npm package that teaches AI agents how to use Loop's REST API. It contains no executable code -- just structured instructions that agents read for context when working in your project.

<Callout type="info">
  The agent skill provides **knowledge** (instructions the agent reads), while the [MCP Server](/docs/mcp) provides **tools** (actions the agent can call). Install both for the best agent experience.
</Callout>

## What's Inside

The package ships four artifacts:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SKILL.md` | Primary skill definition in agentskills.io format. Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Amp, Goose, and any platform that loads SKILL.md files. |
| `templates/AGENTS.md` | Ready-to-paste snippet for your repository's AGENTS.md file (Linux Foundation standard). |
| `templates/loop.mdc` | Cursor rule file for `.cursor/rules/`. Applied on request, not auto-applied. |
| `templates/openhands-loop.md` | OpenHands microagent with keyword triggers (`loop`, `loop api`, `ingest signal`, etc.). |
| `references/api.md` | Full API endpoint reference loaded on demand by agents needing technical details. |

## Installation

<Tabs items={['openskills', 'npm']}>
<Tab value="openskills">

The easiest way to install the skill across any agent platform that supports openskills:

```bash
npx openskills install @dork-labs/loop
```

This downloads the package, copies SKILL.md to your agent's skill directory, and registers the skill for discovery.

</Tab>
<Tab value="npm">

Install the package as a dependency:

```bash
npm install @dork-labs/loop
```

Then reference the files in `node_modules/@dork-labs/loop/` when configuring your agent.

</Tabs>

## What Agents Learn

When an agent reads the skill, it learns:

- **Authentication** -- how to use Bearer token auth with `$LOOP_API_KEY`
- **The dispatch loop** -- the core workflow of get task, do work, report completion, create discovered issues, repeat
- **Common API operations** -- create issues, list issues, ingest signals, complete tasks, add comments
- **Issue types** -- `signal`, `hypothesis`, `plan`, `task`, `monitor`
- **Status values** -- `triage`, `backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`, `done`, `canceled`
- **Error handling** -- what 401, 404, and 422 responses mean and how to recover

## The Dispatch Loop

The skill teaches agents the core Loop workflow:

```
Get next task  -->  Do the work  -->  Report completion  -->  Create discovered issues  -->  Repeat
```

1. **Get next task** -- fetch the highest-priority unblocked issue from Loop
2. **Do the work** -- execute what the issue describes
3. **Report completion** -- update the issue status to `done` and add outcome notes as a comment
4. **Create discovered issues** -- if bugs or new tasks are found during work, create them as new issues
5. **Repeat** -- get the next task and continue the loop

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Claude Code

Claude Code loads SKILL.md files automatically. After installing via openskills or npm, the skill is available in every session.

```bash
npx openskills install @dork-labs/loop
```

Set your API key so the agent can make calls:

```bash
export LOOP_API_KEY=loop_...
```

### Cursor

Copy the Cursor rule file into your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
cp node_modules/@dork-labs/loop/templates/loop.mdc .cursor/rules/loop.mdc
```

The rule is configured as on-request (not auto-applied), so the agent loads it when Loop-related context is needed.

### OpenHands

Copy the microagent into your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .openhands/microagents
cp node_modules/@dork-labs/loop/templates/openhands-loop.md .openhands/microagents/loop.md
```

The microagent triggers automatically when the agent encounters keywords like `loop`, `looped.me`, `loop api`, `loop issue`, or `ingest signal`.

### AGENTS.md

To add Loop context to any agent that reads AGENTS.md (Linux Foundation standard):

```bash
cat node_modules/@dork-labs/loop/templates/AGENTS.md >> AGENTS.md
```

This appends the Loop integration section to your existing AGENTS.md file.

## Common Operations Reference

The skill teaches agents these key API calls:

### Get the next issue to work on

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOOP_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.looped.me/api/issues?status=open&limit=1"
```

### Create an issue

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOOP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Fix login redirect","type":"bug"}' \
  https://app.looped.me/api/issues
```

### Ingest a signal

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOOP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source":"agent","title":"Error rate spike","data":{"count":47}}' \
  https://app.looped.me/api/signals
```

### Complete an issue

```bash
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOOP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"done"}' \
  https://app.looped.me/api/issues/{id}
```

### Add a progress comment

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOOP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"body":"Investigating root cause...","authorName":"agent"}' \
  https://app.looped.me/api/issues/{id}/comments
```
