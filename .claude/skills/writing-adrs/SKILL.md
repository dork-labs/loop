# Writing Architecture Decision Records

## Overview

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture significant technical decisions in a concise, standardized format. They answer "why did we do this?" for future developers and AI agents. Loop ADRs live in `decisions/` with a `manifest.json` index.

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when a decision:

- **Chooses between alternatives** — "We picked X over Y because..."
- **Adopts a pattern or technology** — New library, architecture pattern, data model
- **Has lasting consequences** — Affects how future features are built
- **Would surprise a new team member** — Non-obvious choices that need explanation

## When NOT to Write an ADR

Skip ADRs for:

- **Trivial implementation details** — Variable naming, file placement within an established structure
- **Obvious choices** — Using TypeScript in a TypeScript project
- **Temporary decisions** — Workarounds that will be replaced soon
- **Single-feature scope** — Decisions that only affect one spec with no project-wide impact

## Writing Guidelines

### Context (2-5 sentences)

Focus on the **problem**, not the solution. What situation existed? What forces were at play?

- **Good**: "Loop runs as both a standalone web app and an Obsidian plugin. The Obsidian plugin cannot make HTTP requests to localhost, so the client needs a way to communicate with the server that works in both environments."
- **Bad**: "We needed an architecture." (Too vague)
- **Bad**: A full page of background. (Too long — that belongs in the spec)

### Decision (2-5 sentences)

State what was decided in **active voice**. Start with "We will..."

- **Good**: "We will use a Transport interface that abstracts the communication layer. HttpTransport handles standalone mode via REST/SSE. DirectTransport handles Obsidian mode via in-process function calls."
- **Bad**: "The transport pattern was implemented." (Passive, vague)

### Consequences

List concrete positives and negatives. Every decision has trade-offs — if you can't list a negative, think harder.

- **Positive**: Real benefits the project gains
- **Negative**: Real costs, complexity, or limitations introduced

## Decision Signals in Specs

When scanning specs for ADR candidates, look for:

| Signal                         | Example                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| "We chose X over Y"            | Technology or library selection          |
| "The recommended approach"     | Pattern adoption after comparing options |
| "Trade-offs" section           | Explicit trade-off analysis              |
| "Architecture" or "Design"     | Structural decisions                     |
| "We will not" / "Out of scope" | Deliberate exclusions with rationale     |

## ADR Lifecycle

| Status       | Meaning                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `draft`      | Auto-extracted from spec, not yet evaluated for significance       |
| `proposed`   | Under discussion or promoted from draft, not yet committed         |
| `accepted`   | Active decision guiding implementation                             |
| `deprecated` | No longer relevant (project evolved past it)                       |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a newer ADR (link via `superseded-by`)                 |
| `archived`   | Curation determined this is trivial; moved to `decisions/archive/` |

### Auto-Extraction

Draft ADRs are created automatically by `/ideate-to-spec` (Step 7.0) when a spec is validated. Every decision signal is captured as a draft. The `/adr:curate` command (triggered daily via SessionStart hook) evaluates drafts against the criteria in "When to Write an ADR" above:

- **Promote** (draft → proposed): Meets 2+ criteria
- **Archive** (draft → archived): Meets 0-1 criteria, moved to `decisions/archive/`

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too long** — ADRs are not specs. Keep each section to 2-5 sentences.
- **Missing negative consequences** — Every decision has costs. Be honest.
- **Vague context** — "We needed a better solution" tells nothing. What was broken?
- **Solution in context** — Context describes the problem, not the answer.
- **No spec link** — If a spec drove this decision, always link it.

## File Conventions

- **Location**: `decisions/NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`
- **Numbers**: Zero-padded 4 digits (0001, 0002, ...)
- **Manifest**: `decisions/manifest.json` tracks all ADRs
- **Template**: `decisions/TEMPLATE.md` for the standard format
