# MoSCoW Prioritization Guide

## Overview

MoSCoW is a prioritization method that categorizes requirements into four groups:

| Category        | Meaning                                  | Guideline                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Must Have**   | Critical - without it, the project fails | Keep <60% of total effort |
| **Should Have** | Important but not time-critical          | Can be delayed if needed  |
| **Could Have**  | Desirable but not necessary              | Include if time permits   |
| **Won't Have**  | Explicitly out of scope for now          | Prevents scope creep      |

## The 60% Rule

**Must-Have items should never exceed 60% of total effort.**

If Must-Haves exceed 60%:

- Project predictability decreases
- Risk of missing deadlines increases
- Team becomes overwhelmed
- Quality suffers

## How to Categorize

### Must Have

Ask: "Will the project fail without this?"

- Core functionality that defines the product
- Regulatory or compliance requirements
- Critical integrations
- Blockers for other Must-Have items

### Should Have

Ask: "Is this important but survivable without?"

- Significant user value but workarounds exist
- Important for user satisfaction
- Can wait for next iteration

### Could Have

Ask: "Would this be nice to have?"

- Quality of life improvements
- Nice-to-have features
- Polish and refinement
- Low effort, incremental value

### Won't Have

Ask: "Should we explicitly defer this?"

- Out of scope for current timeline
- Low priority relative to others
- Requires dependencies not yet built
- Good ideas for future consideration

## Common Mistakes

1. **Everything is Must-Have** - Forces difficult trade-offs later
2. **No Won't-Have items** - Invites scope creep
3. **Skipping Should-Have** - Blurs the line between critical and optional
4. **Not revisiting priorities** - Context changes; priorities should too

## Integration with Time Horizons

| Time Horizon | Typical MoSCoW Mix                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Now**      | Mostly Must-Have, some Should-Have |
| **Next**     | Mix of Should-Have and Could-Have  |
| **Later**    | Could-Have and future Must-Haves   |

## Review Cadence

- **Weekly**: Quick health check on Must-Have items
- **Sprint boundary**: Re-evaluate priorities
- **Monthly**: Full roadmap review with stakeholders
