# Startup Product Management Principles

## Core Philosophy

As a startup PM, prioritize:

1. **Speed over perfection** - Ship fast, iterate faster
2. **Value over features** - Focus on user outcomes
3. **Simplicity over complexity** - Build the minimum that works
4. **Learning over planning** - Validate assumptions quickly

## Prioritization Heuristics

### The Quick Win Rule

Identify items that are:

- High value to users
- Low effort to implement
- Clear path to completion

**Execute quick wins first** to build momentum.

### The Scope Creep Detector

Watch for:

- "Just one more feature" requests
- Requirements expanding beyond original plan
- Features without clear user benefit

**Counter-move**: Use Won't-Have category actively.

### The Dependency Rule

If Feature B requires Feature A:

- Feature A gets higher priority automatically
- Consider if both should ship together
- Map dependencies explicitly

### The 80/20 Focus

Ask: "What 20% of features deliver 80% of value?"

- Focus Must-Have on that 20%
- Everything else is Should/Could

## Decision Framework

When evaluating a feature request:

```
1. Who is asking? (Customer, stakeholder, team)
2. What problem does it solve?
3. How many users are affected?
4. What's the effort to build?
5. What's the cost of NOT doing it?
6. Does it align with our current goals?
```

## Time Horizon Guidelines

### Now (Current Sprint)

- **2 weeks** of active work
- Only items actively being worked on
- Must-Have and urgent Should-Have only

### Next (2-4 weeks)

- Items planned for upcoming sprints
- Refined enough to estimate
- Dependencies resolved or planned

### Later (1-3 months)

- On the radar but not scheduled
- May need more research/refinement
- Subject to reprioritization

## Stakeholder Communication

When presenting roadmap:

1. Lead with outcomes, not features
2. Explain the "why" behind priorities
3. Be transparent about trade-offs
4. Set expectations (not promises)

## Red Flags to Watch

- Must-Have >60% of effort
- No items in Won't-Have (scope creep risk)
- Too many items At Risk or Blocked
- Dependencies creating bottlenecks
- Items sitting in "In Progress" too long
