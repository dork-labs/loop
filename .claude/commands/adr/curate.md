# Curate Draft ADRs

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Read Draft ADRs

Read `decisions/manifest.json` and filter for entries with `"status": "draft"`.

If no drafts exist:
1. Update `decisions/.last-curated` with current ISO timestamp
2. Display: "No draft ADRs to curate."
3. Exit.

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Draft

For each draft ADR:

1. Read the full ADR file at `decisions/NNNN-{slug}.md`
2. Evaluate against these significance criteria (from the `writing-adrs` skill):

| # | Criterion | How to Assess |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Chooses between alternatives** | Does the ADR describe selecting X over Y? Or just "we used X"? |
| 2 | **Project-wide impact** | Does this affect how future features are built, beyond the originating spec? |
| 3 | **Would surprise a new team member** | Is this a non-obvious choice that needs explanation? |
| 4 | **Adopts a lasting pattern or technology** | New library, architecture pattern, data model with long-term consequences? |

3. Score: count how many criteria are met (0-4)
4. Decision:
   - **Score >= 2**: Promote (draft -> proposed)
   - **Score <= 1**: Archive

### Step 3: Promote Significant ADRs

For each ADR to promote:

1. Edit the ADR file:
   - Change frontmatter `status: draft` to `status: proposed`
   - Change Status section from "Draft (auto-extracted...)" to "Proposed"
2. Update `decisions/manifest.json`: change the entry's status to `"proposed"`

### Step 4: Archive Trivial ADRs

For each ADR to archive:

1. Move the file: `mv decisions/NNNN-{slug}.md decisions/archive/NNNN-{slug}.md`
2. Remove the entry from `decisions/manifest.json` `decisions` array

### Step 5: Update Timestamp

Write current ISO timestamp to `decisions/.last-curated`:

```bash
date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" > decisions/.last-curated
```

### Step 6: Display Summary

```
ADR Curation Complete

  Promoted (draft -> proposed):
    - 0006: [Title]
    - 0007: [Title]

  Archived:
    - 0008: [Title] -> decisions/archive/0008-[slug].md
    - 0009: [Title] -> decisions/archive/0009-[slug].md

  Summary: N promoted, M archived
```

## Notes

- This command is typically triggered automatically via SessionStart hook
- It can also be run manually at any time: `/adr:curate`
- Archived ADRs are preserved in `decisions/archive/` but removed from the manifest
- To recover an archived ADR, manually move it back and re-add to manifest
