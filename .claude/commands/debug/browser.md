# Browser Debug

Debug and resolve issues observed in the browser. Handles visual problems (design system violations, layout issues) and technical problems (console errors, interaction failures, data issues).

## Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

- If `--url <url>` flag provided, extract the URL
- Remaining text is the issue description
- Both are optional; prompt if missing

## Phase 1: Issue Intake

### 1.1 Gather Missing Information

**If URL not provided**, ask:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What URL should I navigate to?"
  header: "URL"
  options:
    - label: "localhost:3000"
      description: "Home page"
    - label: "localhost:3000/accounts"
      description: "Accounts page"
    - label: "localhost:3000/transactions"
      description: "Transactions page"
```

**If description not provided or vague**, ask about issue type:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What type of issue are you seeing?"
  header: "Issue Type"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Visual/Layout"
      description: "Wrong spacing, fonts, colors, alignment, or design inconsistency"
    - label: "Interaction"
      description: "Button, form, or link not working as expected"
    - label: "Data Display"
      description: "Wrong data, stale content, or loading issues"
    - label: "Responsive"
      description: "Looks wrong on certain screen sizes"
```

### 1.2 Additional Context

Ask follow-up questions:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "When did you first notice this issue?"
  header: "Timeline"
  options:
    - label: "Just now"
      description: "Started in current session"
    - label: "After recent changes"
      description: "Noticed after code modifications"
    - label: "Intermittent"
      description: "Happens sometimes, not consistently"
    - label: "Always"
      description: "Consistent behavior"
```

## Phase 2: Initial Assessment

### 2.1 Pre-flight Checks

```bash
# Check if dev server is running
if ! curl -s http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "⚠️  Dev server not responding. Check that 'pnpm dev' is running."
fi

# Check latest dev server log for errors
LATEST_LOG=$(ls -t .logs/ 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -n "$LATEST_LOG" ]; then
  echo "📋 Recent server log entries:"
  grep -i "error\|failed\|exception" ".logs/$LATEST_LOG" | tail -10
fi
```

### 2.2 Navigate and Capture Initial State

```
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate: { url: "[provided-url]" }
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot: {}
mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages: { level: "debug" }
mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests: { includeStatic: false }
```

### 2.3 Check Dev Server Logs

```bash
# Read latest log for context
cat ".logs/$(ls -t .logs/ | head -1)" | tail -50
```

### 2.4 Classify Issue Type

Based on gathered data, classify the issue:

| Classification  | Indicators                                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visual**      | No console errors, visual discrepancy from design system |
| **Interaction** | Console errors on action, event handler issues           |
| **Data**        | API failures, wrong response shape, stale cache          |
| **Performance** | Slow loading, console timing warnings                    |
| **Responsive**  | Layout shifts at breakpoints                             |

## Phase 3: Deep Diagnosis

### 3.0 Parallel Diagnostic Agents (Optional)

When the issue is complex or unclear, launch parallel diagnostic agents:

```
# Launch all diagnostic agents simultaneously
visual_agent = Task(
  description: "Audit visual/design system compliance",
  prompt: """
    Conduct a systematic design system audit for the affected area.

    Check against the Calm Tech design system:
    1. Typography: Geist Sans/Mono, correct sizes (11/13/15/17/20/24/30/36/48px)
    2. Spacing: 8px base (4/8/12/16/20/24/32/48/64px)
    3. Colors: No pure black/white, semantic tokens used
    4. Shapes: Cards rounded-xl (16px), buttons rounded-md (10px)
    5. Shadows: Using project shadows (shadow-soft, shadow-elevated)
    6. Animation: 100-300ms duration, correct easing

### For Visual Issues

**Invoke the `designing-frontend` skill:**

```
Skill: { skill: "designing-frontend" }
```

**Conduct systematic Design System Audit:**

#### 1. Typography Audit

- [ ] Is font Geist Sans/Mono? (no Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- [ ] Does size match type scale? (11/13/15/17/20/24/30/36/48px)
- [ ] Is weight appropriate? (400+ for body, 500-700 for headings)
- [ ] Is letter-spacing correct for display text? (-0.02em to -0.025em)

#### 2. Spacing Audit

- [ ] Does spacing follow 8px base? (4/8/12/16/20/24/32/48/64px)
- [ ] Is card padding 24px (p-6)?
- [ ] Are gaps 16px default, 24px for card grids?

#### 3. Color Audit

- [ ] No pure black (#000) or white (#fff)?
- [ ] Using semantic tokens (bg-primary, text-muted-foreground)?
- [ ] WCAG AA contrast met (4.5:1 for text)?

#### 4. Shape Audit

- [ ] Cards using rounded-xl (16px)?
- [ ] Buttons using rounded-md (10px)?
- [ ] Inputs matching button radius?

#### 5. Shadow Audit

- [ ] Using project shadows (shadow-soft, shadow-elevated, shadow-floating)?
- [ ] Shadows diffused, not harsh?

#### 6. Animation Audit (if applicable)

- [ ] Duration between 100-300ms?
- [ ] Correct easing curve? (ease-out for enter, ease-in for exit)
- [ ] prefers-reduced-motion respected?

**Take targeted screenshot if needed:**

```
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot: {
  element: "[description of element]",
  ref: "[ref from snapshot]"
}
```

### For Interaction Issues

1. **Attempt the interaction:**

```
mcp__playwright__browser_click: {
  element: "[description]",
  ref: "[ref]"
}
```

2. **Check console for new errors:**

```
mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages: { level: "error" }
```

3. **Evaluate the result:**

```
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot: {}
```

4. **Trace component code path** to find event handlers

### For Data Issues

1. **Check network request details:**

```
mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests: { includeStatic: false }
```

2. **Check server logs for API errors:**

```bash
grep -E "POST|GET|error|failed" ".logs/$(ls -t .logs/ | head -1)" | tail -20
```

3. **Trace data flow in code:**
   - Find the component displaying the data
   - Find the TanStack Query hook or server action
   - Find the DAL function
   - Check for cache invalidation issues

### For Responsive Issues

**Test at key breakpoints:**

```
mcp__playwright__browser_resize: { width: 375, height: 667 }   # Mobile
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot: {}

mcp__playwright__browser_resize: { width: 768, height: 1024 }  # Tablet
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot: {}

mcp__playwright__browser_resize: { width: 1280, height: 800 }  # Desktop
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot: {}
```

**Check for:**

- Responsive class usage (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- Touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Content overflow issues

## Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis

### 4.1 State the Issue Clearly

```markdown
**Observed:** [What you see]
**Expected:** [What it should be according to design system/spec]
**Impact:** [User experience impact]
```

### 4.2 Trace to Source Code

**For complex searches**, use code-search agent:

```
Task:
  description: "Find [component/function]"
  subagent_type: "code-search"
  prompt: "Find the source code for [specific element]. Look for: [search terms]"
```

**For simpler cases**, use direct search:

```
Glob: { pattern: "**/[component-name]*" }
Grep: { pattern: "[search-term]", type: "tsx" }
```

### 4.3 Validate Assumptions

**BEFORE making changes:**

- Read the relevant component code
- Understand the data flow
- Check for intentional design decisions
- Look for comments explaining choices

### 4.4 Research If Needed

**For library issues:**

```
mcp__context7__resolve-library-id: { libraryName: "[library]" }
mcp__context7__query-docs: {
  context7CompatibleLibraryID: "[id]",
  topic: "[specific issue]"
}
```

**For complex issues**, spawn research agent:

```
Task:
  description: "Research [issue]"
  subagent_type: "research-expert"
  prompt: "Research how to [solve specific problem]. Focus on [specifics]."
```

## Phase 5: Implementation

### 5.1 Create Mini-Plan

Document 3-5 steps maximum:

```
TodoWrite:
  todos:
    - content: "[Step 1]"
      activeForm: "[Step 1 active]"
      status: "pending"
    - content: "[Step 2]"
      activeForm: "[Step 2 active]"
      status: "pending"
```

### 5.2 Make Changes

For each change:

1. **Read the file first** - never edit without reading
2. **Make targeted edits** - minimal changes to fix the issue
3. **Verify syntax** with typecheck
4. **Mark task complete** as you go

### 5.3 Verify Build

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
```

## Phase 6: Verification

### 6.1 Test the Fix

```
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate: { url: "[url]" }
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot: {}
```

### 6.2 Compare Results

- Does the issue appear resolved?
- Are there any new console errors?
- Did the fix introduce visual regressions?

### 6.3 Test Edge Cases

Based on issue type:

- **Visual:** Check dark mode, responsive sizes
- **Interaction:** Test success and error states
- **Data:** Test loading, empty, and error states

### 6.4 If Issue Persists

Continue debugging:

1. Review what was learned
2. Identify what was missed
3. Try alternative approach
4. Ask user for more context if stuck

**Do not give up after one attempt. Iterate until resolved or blocked.**

## Phase 7: Wrap-Up

### 7.1 Summarize the Fix

```markdown
## Issue Resolved

**Problem:** [Original issue description]
**Root Cause:** [What caused it]
**Solution:** [What was changed]
**Files Modified:** [List of files]
```

### 7.2 Suggest Improvements (Optional)

If noticed during debugging:

- Related components with same issue
- Opportunities to use design tokens
- Missing component variants
- Potential refactoring

### 7.3 Recommend Regression Prevention

Suggest:

- Component test for the fix
- Visual regression test consideration
- Design token usage to prevent future issues

### 7.4 Offer Next Steps

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What would you like to do next?"
  header: "Next Steps"
  options:
    - label: "Test another issue"
      description: "Continue debugging something else"
    - label: "Commit the fix"
      description: "Run /git:commit to stage and commit changes"
    - label: "Done"
      description: "I'm satisfied with the fix"
```

## Quick Reference

### Common Design System Violations

| Issue           | Check                     | Fix                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Wrong font      | `font-sans` class missing | Add `font-sans` or check font loading           |
| Harsh borders   | Pure black/white colors   | Use `border-border` or theme colors             |
| Cramped cards   | Padding < 24px            | Use `p-6` for card padding                      |
| Square corners  | Wrong radius              | Cards: `rounded-xl`, Buttons: `rounded-md`      |
| Hard shadows    | Non-diffused shadows      | Use `shadow-soft` or `shadow-elevated`          |
| Giant text      | Wrong scale level         | Match to type scale (11/13/15/17/20/24/30/36px) |
| Janky animation | Wrong duration/easing     | 100-300ms, ease-out for enter                   |

### Agent Usage

Use specialized agents when needed:

| Scenario             | Agent                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Complex CSS/layout   | `react-tanstack-expert` |
| Type errors found    | `typescript-expert`     |
| Database/API issues  | `prisma-expert`         |
| Deep research needed | `research-expert`       |
| Multi-file search    | `code-search`           |

### Skills to Invoke

- `designing-frontend` - For visual audits and design system compliance
- `using-tailwind-shadcn` - For styling patterns and component specs

### Emergency Shortcuts

For quick fixes when you know the issue:

```bash
# Find component by name
rg -l "ComponentName" src/

# Find all styling for element
rg "className.*element-name" src/

# Check dark mode variant
rg "dark:" src/path/to/file.tsx

# Find Tailwind classes
rg "rounded-|shadow-|text-|bg-|p-|m-" src/path/to/file.tsx
```

## Important Behaviors

1. **ALWAYS** take a browser snapshot before making changes
2. **ALWAYS** read component code before editing
3. **ALWAYS** validate design system compliance for visual issues
4. **ALWAYS** check console logs and network requests
5. **ALWAYS** verify the fix in the browser after changes
6. **ITERATE** if the fix doesn't work - don't give up after one attempt
7. **OFFER** to continue if issues persist
8. **ESCALATE** complex issues - offer to create a spec via `/spec:create`

## Edge Cases

- **Dev server not running**: Prompt user to start it with `pnpm dev`
- **URL returns 404/500**: Check route exists, check for server errors
- **Hot reload issues**: Suggest hard refresh or dev server restart
- **Multiple issues detected**: Prioritize, fix one at a time, track with TodoWrite
- **Issue is too complex**: Offer to create a proper spec with `/spec:create`
