# Process Post-Implementation Feedback

Process ONE specific piece of feedback from testing/usage with structured workflow including code exploration, optional research, interactive decisions, and spec updates.

## Context-Saving Architecture

This command uses **parallel background agents** for discovery:

1. **Main context**: Validation, feedback collection, decisions (~20% of context)
2. **Exploration agent**: Code investigation (background, isolated)
3. **Research agent**: Best practices (background, parallel with exploration)
4. **Main context**: Interactive decisions and file updates

**Context savings**: ~75% reduction vs sequential foreground execution

**Performance**: Exploration and research run in parallel when both requested

---

## Phase 1: Validation & Setup (Main Context - Lightweight)

### Step 1.1: Extract Feature Slug

Extract the slug from the spec path:

- `specs/<slug>/02-specification.md` → slug is `<slug>`
- `specs/feat-<name>.md` (legacy) → slug is `feat-<name>`
- `specs/fix-<issue>-<desc>.md` (legacy) → slug is `fix-<issue>-<desc>`

```bash
SPEC_PATH="$ARGUMENTS"
SLUG=$(echo "$SPEC_PATH" | cut -d'/' -f2)
```

### Step 1.2: Validate Prerequisites

1. **Check implementation exists**: `specs/<slug>/04-implementation.md` must exist
   - If missing → "❌ Error: Run `/spec:execute` first"
   - Exit early

2. **Check for incomplete tasks**:

   ```
   tasks = TaskList()
   in_progress = tasks.filter(t =>
     t.subject.includes("[<slug>]") &&
     t.status === "in_progress"
   )
   ```

   - If any found → Display warning (not a blocker)

Display:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Ready to process feedback for: [slug]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Implementation summary found
⚠️ [X] task(s) still in progress (if any)
```

---

## Phase 2: Feedback Collection (Main Context)

### Step 2.1: Prompt for Feedback

Display:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           Provide Feedback from Testing/Usage                 ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Please provide ONE specific piece of feedback from your testing:

Examples of good feedback:
• "Authentication fails when password contains special characters"
• "Dashboard loading is slow with >100 items"
• "Error messages are not user-friendly"

Guidelines:
- Be specific about what's wrong or what could be improved
- Include relevant context (conditions, data, steps to reproduce)
- One issue per feedback session

Your feedback:
```

Wait for user input.

### Step 2.2: Categorize Feedback Type

Analyze feedback text to determine type:

| Type        | Keywords                        | Focus                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bug/Error   | fail, error, crash, broken, bug | Error handling, edge cases    |
| Performance | slow, lag, timeout, delay       | Bottlenecks, optimization     |
| UX/UI       | confusing, unclear, hard to     | User flows, UI components     |
| Security    | security, auth, permission      | Security controls, validation |
| General     | (other)                         | Overall implementation        |

Display: "📋 Categorized as: [type]"

---

## Phase 3: Parallel Discovery (Background Agents)

### Step 3.1: Ask About Research

Use AskUserQuestion:

```
"Would you like research-expert to investigate best practices for this issue?"
Options:
- "Yes - Investigate approaches" (Recommended for complex issues)
- "No - Continue with code exploration only"
```

### Step 3.2: Launch Exploration Agent

Always launch the exploration agent in background:

```
Task(
  description: "Explore code for [slug] feedback",
  prompt: <see EXPLORATION_AGENT_PROMPT>,
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  model: "haiku",
  run_in_background: true
)
```

Store as `exploration_task_id`.

### Step 3.3: Launch Research Agent (If Requested)

If user selected "Yes - Investigate approaches":

```
Task(
  description: "Research solutions for [slug] feedback",
  prompt: <see RESEARCH_AGENT_PROMPT>,
  subagent_type: "research-expert",
  model: "haiku",
  run_in_background: true
)
```

Store as `research_task_id`.

Display:

```
🔄 Discovery started:
   → Code exploration: Investigating affected areas
   → Research: Analyzing best practices (if requested)

   Running in background...
```

### Step 3.4: Collect Results

Wait for exploration:

```
TaskOutput(task_id: exploration_task_id, block: true)
```

Wait for research (if launched):

```
TaskOutput(task_id: research_task_id, block: true)
```

Display:

```
✅ Discovery complete
```

## Phase 4: Interactive Decisions (Main Context)

### Step 4.1: Display Findings Summary

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                  FINDINGS SUMMARY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Feedback: [user's feedback text]
Type: [categorized type]

--- CODE EXPLORATION FINDINGS ---
[summary of exploration findings]

--- RESEARCH FINDINGS ---
[research findings or "Research skipped by user"]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Step 4.2: Gather Decisions

**Question 1: Action**

```
"How would you like to address this feedback?"
Options:
- "Implement now" - Update spec and re-run implementation
- "Defer" - Log and create task for later
- "Out of scope" - Log only, no action
```

**Question 2: Scope** (If "Implement now")

```
"What implementation scope?"
Options:
- "Minimal" - Only the specific issue
- "Comprehensive" - Issue plus related improvements
- "Phased" - Quick fix now, comprehensive later
```

**Question 3: Approach** (If "Implement now" and multiple approaches found)

```
"Which implementation approach?"
Options:
- [Approaches from research/exploration]
- "Custom approach"
```

**Question 4: Priority** (If "Implement now" or "Defer")

```
"Priority level?"
Options:
- "Critical" - Blocks core functionality
- "High" - Significant impact
- "Medium" - Noticeable but workarounds exist
- "Low" - Minor inconvenience
```

Display:

```
✓ Decisions captured
  Action: [selected]
  Scope: [selected]
  Priority: [selected]
```

## Phase 5: Execute Actions (Main Context)

### If "Implement now"

1. **Add changelog entry** to `specs/<slug>/02-specification.md`:

```markdown
### [current-date] - Post-Implementation Feedback

**Source:** Feedback #[N] (see specs/[slug]/05-feedback.md)

**Issue:** [user's feedback text]

# "Authentication fails when password contains special characters"

# The command will:
# 1. Validate prerequisites
# 2. Categorize as Bug/Error type
# 3. Launch exploration (background)
# 4. Optionally launch research (background, parallel)
# 5. Present findings and gather decisions
# 6. Update spec/log as appropriate
```

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric                 | Sequential            | Parallel (This Command) |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Exploration + Research | ~6-8 min              | ~3-4 min (2x faster)    |
| Context usage          | 100% in main          | ~25% in main            |
| User wait time         | Blocked during agents | Only during collection  |

---

## Integration with Other Commands

| Command           | Relationship                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/spec:execute`   | **Prerequisite** - Must complete before feedback            |
| `/spec:decompose` | **Run after** (if "Implement now") - Updates task breakdown |
| `/spec:execute`   | **Run after decompose** - Implements changes                |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No implementation found"

Run `/spec:execute` first to complete initial implementation.

### "X tasks still in progress"

Warning only - can proceed. Feedback changes may affect them.

### Research taking too long

Research runs in background. Can skip research for simpler issues.
