# Roadmap Analyze

Perform a comprehensive health check of the roadmap with detailed analysis.

## Usage

```
/roadmap:analyze
```

## Implementation

### Step 1: Run Health Check

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/managing-roadmap-moscow/scripts/check_health.py
```

### Step 2: Run Validation

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/managing-roadmap-moscow/scripts/validate_roadmap.py
```

### Step 3: Generate Report

Compile a detailed report including:

#### MoSCoW Distribution

- Must-Have % (warn if >60%)
- Count and effort by priority level

#### Status Breakdown

- Not Started
- In Progress
- Completed
- On Hold

#### Health Indicators

- Items at risk
- Blocked items
- Items missing effort estimates

#### Dependency Analysis

- Items with unresolved dependencies
- Dependency chains
- Potential bottlenecks

#### Timeline Analysis

- Items in each horizon (Now, Next, Later)
- Overdue items (in "Now" but not started)
- Items without time horizon

## Output Format

```markdown
## Roadmap Health Report

### Overall Health: [Good/Warning/Critical]

### MoSCoW Distribution

| Priority    | Count | Effort | % of Total |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| Must-Have   | X     | Y days | Z%         |
| Should-Have | X     | Y days | Z%         |
| Could-Have  | X     | Y days | Z%         |
| Won't-Have  | X     | -      | -          |

⚠️ Warning: Must-Have exceeds 60% threshold

### Status Breakdown

- Not Started: X items
- In Progress: X items
- Completed: X items
- On Hold: X items

### Items Needing Attention

#### At Risk (2)

- "Feature A" - No progress in 2 weeks
- "Feature B" - Dependency blocked

#### Blocked (1)

- "Feature C" - Waiting on external API

#### Missing Estimates (3)

- "Feature D", "Feature E", "Feature F"
