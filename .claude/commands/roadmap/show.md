# Roadmap Show

Display a text-based roadmap summary directly in the terminal. Useful when you need a quick overview without opening a browser.

## Usage

```
/roadmap:show
```

## When to Use

- Quick CLI view without leaving the terminal
- When the dev server isn't running
- In CI/CD pipelines or scripts
- When you just need stats, not the full visualization

**For the full visual experience**, use `/roadmap:open` to view the interactive roadmap at `http://localhost:3000/roadmap`.

## Implementation

Run the generate_summary.py script and display the output:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/managing-roadmap-moscow/scripts/generate_summary.py
```

## Output

The summary includes:

- Items grouped by time horizon (Now, Next, Later)
- Sub-grouped by MoSCoW priority (Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Won't-Have)
- Status indicators (not-started, in-progress, completed, on-hold)
- Health indicators (at-risk, blocked items)
- Statistics (total items, must-have %, in-progress count, at-risk count)

## Example Output

```
