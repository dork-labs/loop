# System Release Command (Orchestrator)

Create a new release by bumping the version, updating the changelog, creating a git tag, publishing to npm, and optionally creating a GitHub Release.

This command operates as an **orchestrator** that:

- Runs quick pre-flight checks in main context
- Delegates context-heavy analysis to a subagent (keeps main context clean)
- Handles user interaction and git operations in main context

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Optional bump type or explicit version, plus optional flags:
  - _(no argument)_ - **Auto-detect** version bump from changelog and commits
  - `patch` - Force patch version (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
  - `minor` - Force minor version (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)
  - `major` - Force major version (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)
  - `X.Y.Z` - Explicit version number (e.g., `0.2.0`)
  - `--dry-run` - Show what would happen without making changes

## Semantic Versioning

| Bump Type | When to Use                                  | Example        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **MAJOR** | Breaking changes to user config or workflows | 0.1.0 -> 1.0.0 |
| **MINOR** | New features, backward compatible            | 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0 |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes, documentation updates             | 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1 |

## Architecture

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    MAIN CONTEXT (Orchestrator)                |
|                                                               |
|  Phase 1: Parse arguments                                     |
|  Phase 2: Pre-flight checks (git status, branch, VERSION)     |
|           |                                                   |
|  Phase 3: If auto-detect needed -> spawn analysis agent       |
|           |                                                   |
|  Phase 4: Present recommendation, get user confirmation       |
|  Phase 5: Execute release (VERSION, package.json, changelog,  |
|           git, pnpm publish)                                   |
|  Phase 6: Report results                                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
                           |
                           v (only if auto-detect)
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|              SUBAGENT: Release Analyzer                       |
|              (context-isolator, model: haiku)                 |
|                                                               |
|  - Read changelog [Unreleased] section                        |
|  - Get commits since last tag                                 |
|  - Analyze patterns (feat:, fix:, BREAKING, etc.)             |
|  - Return structured recommendation                           |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine:

- **Bump type**: `patch`, `minor`, `major`, explicit version, or **auto** (default)
- **Dry run**: Whether `--dry-run` flag is present

---

## Phase 2: Pre-flight Checks

Run these quick validation checks in main context:

```bash
# Check 1: Working directory is clean
git status --porcelain
```

If output is not empty, **STOP** and report:

```
## Cannot Release: Uncommitted Changes

You have uncommitted changes in the working directory:
[list files]

Please commit or stash your changes before releasing:
- `git add . && git commit -m "your message"`
- Or: `git stash`
```

```bash
# Check 2: On main branch
git branch --show-current
```

If not `main`, **STOP** and report:

```
## Cannot Release: Not on Main Branch

You are on branch `[branch]`. Releases must be created from `main`.

Switch to main: `git checkout main`
```

```bash
# Check 3: Read current version from VERSION file (single source of truth)
cat VERSION
```

```bash
# Check 4: Get latest tag for comparison
git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "none"
```

```bash
# Check 5: Local build passes
pnpm run build
```

If the build fails, **STOP** and report:

```
## Cannot Release: Build Failing

The local build failed. Fix build errors before releasing:
[error output]
```

```bash
# Check 6: Analyze commits since last tag for changelog completeness
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "")..HEAD --oneline
```

Parse the git log output to identify commits not represented in the [Unreleased] section of CHANGELOG.md:

- Read the current [Unreleased] section from CHANGELOG.md
- Compare commit messages against existing entries
- Categorize missing commits by conventional commit type:
  - feat: / feat(...) -> Added
  - fix: / fix(...) -> Fixed
  - refactor: / chore: / docs: -> Changed
  - BREAKING CHANGE or "!" after type -> Breaking

### If missing entries exist (changelog is incomplete)

Report and ask:

```markdown
## Changelog Review

**Since tag**: [last_tag]
**Commits analyzed**: [count]
**Current entries**: [count from Unreleased section]
**Missing entries**: [count]

### Missing from Changelog

The following commits are not represented in the [Unreleased] section:

#### Added

- [user-friendly description] ([short sha])
  _From_: `[original commit message]`

#### Fixed

- [user-friendly description] ([short sha])
  _From_: `[original commit message]`
```

Use AskUserQuestion:

```
header: "Backfill"
question: "Add missing entries to changelog before releasing?"
options:
  - label: "Yes, add all missing entries (Recommended)"
    description: "Ensures release notes capture all changes since last release"
  - label: "No, release with current changelog"
    description: "Use only entries already in [Unreleased]"
  - label: "Cancel and edit manually"
    description: "Exit so you can edit the changelog yourself"
```

If user selects "Yes, add all": Use the Edit tool to add the missing entries to the appropriate sections in the [Unreleased] block of CHANGELOG.md. Rewrite entries to be user-friendly using the `/writing-changelogs` skill guidelines:

- Focus on what users can DO, not what files changed
- Use imperative verbs (Add, Fix, Change, Remove)
- Explain benefits, not just mechanisms

Then continue to Phase 3.

### If no entries exist at all (completely empty)

If both the [Unreleased] section and commit history are empty since the last release:

```
## Cannot Release: No Changes

Both the [Unreleased] section and commit history are empty since the last release.
There's nothing to release.

**Tip**: Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, etc.) so changes are easy to track.
```

**STOP** the release process.

---

## Phase 3: Version Analysis

### If explicit bump type provided (patch/minor/major/X.Y.Z)

Skip analysis, calculate next version directly:

| Current | Bump Type | Next  |
| ------- | --------- | ----- |
| 0.1.0   | patch     | 0.1.1 |
| 0.1.0   | minor     | 0.2.0 |
| 0.1.0   | major     | 1.0.0 |

Proceed to Phase 4.

### If auto-detect needed (no bump type)

**Spawn a context-isolator agent** to analyze changes and recommend version bump.

This keeps the main context clean by offloading the changelog parsing and commit analysis.

````
Task tool:
  subagent_type: context-isolator
  model: haiku
  description: "Analyze changes for release"
  prompt: |
    ## Release Analysis Task

    Analyze the changes since the last release and recommend a version bump.

    **Current version:** [from VERSION file]
    **Last tag:** [from git describe]

    ### Step 1: Read Changelog

    Read the [Unreleased] section from `CHANGELOG.md`:
    - Extract content between `## [Unreleased]` and the next `## [` heading
    - Note which sections have content: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Deprecated

    ### Step 2: Get Commits

    Run: `git log [last_tag]..HEAD --oneline`
    - Count commits by type (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:, etc.)
    - Look for BREAKING CHANGE or ! markers

    ### Step 3: Apply Detection Rules

    **MAJOR signals (any of these):**
    - Changelog contains "BREAKING" or "Breaking"
    - "### Removed" section has content
    - Commits contain "BREAKING CHANGE:" or "!" after type (e.g., "feat!:")

    **MINOR signals (any of these):**
    - "### Added" section has content
    - Commits contain "feat:" or "feat("

    **PATCH (default):**
    - Only "### Fixed" or "### Changed" with minor changes
    - Only "fix:", "docs:", "chore:" commits

    ### Step 4: Transform Entries to User-Friendly Language

    For each changelog entry, rewrite to be user-focused:
    - Focus on what users can DO, not what files changed
    - Use imperative verbs (Add, Fix, Change, Remove)
    - Explain benefits, not just mechanisms

    **Examples:**
    - Bad: "Add obsidian_manager.py for auto vault registration"
    - Good: "Open files in Obsidian without manual vault setup"
    - Bad: "fix: Use relative paths in theme commands"
    - Good: "Fix theme commands failing when run from different directories"

    ### Step 5: Return Structured Result

    Return your analysis in this EXACT format:

    ```
    RECOMMENDED_BUMP: [MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH]
    NEXT_VERSION: [X.Y.Z]

    CHANGELOG_SIGNALS:
    - Added: [count] items
    - Changed: [count] items
    - Fixed: [count] items
    - Removed: [count] items
    - Breaking: [yes/no]

    COMMIT_SIGNALS:
    - Total commits: [N]
    - feat: [count]
    - fix: [count]
    - docs: [count]
    - other: [count]
    - Breaking markers: [yes/no]

    REASONING:
    [1-2 sentence explanation of why this bump type]

    CHANGELOG_CONTENT_RAW:
    [The original [Unreleased] section content]

    CHANGELOG_CONTENT_IMPROVED:
    [User-friendly rewritten version of the changelog entries]

    RELEASE_THEME:
    [1 sentence describing the focus/theme of this release for GitHub release notes]

    RELEASE_HIGHLIGHTS:
    [2-3 most significant changes with emoji and benefit explanation]
    ```
````

**Parse the agent's response** to extract:

- `RECOMMENDED_BUMP`
- `NEXT_VERSION`
- Signals for display
- Reasoning
- Raw and improved changelog content
- Release theme and highlights for GitHub release notes

---

## Phase 4: Present and Confirm

Present the release plan to the user:

```markdown
## Release Preview

**Current Version**: v0.1.0
**New Version**: v0.2.0
**Bump Type**: MINOR (auto-detected)

### Reasoning

[Agent's reasoning from Phase 3]

### Analysis Summary

**Changelog signals:**

- [check] "### Added" section has 3 items
- [x] No breaking changes detected
- [check] "### Fixed" section has 2 items

**Commit signals (12 commits):**

- 4 feat: commits
- 6 fix: commits
- 2 docs: commits

### Changes to be Released

[Changelog content from agent]

### Files to be Modified

1. `VERSION` - 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
2. `packages/types/package.json` - 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
3. `packages/sdk/package.json` - 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
4. `packages/mcp/package.json` - 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
5. `apps/cli/package.json` - 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
6. `packages/loop-connect/package.json` - 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
7. `packages/loop-skill/package.json` - 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
8. `package.json` - 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
9. `pnpm-lock.yaml` - updated by pnpm version
10. `CHANGELOG.md` - [Unreleased] -> [0.2.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Git Operations

1. Commit: "chore(release): v0.2.0"
2. Tag: v0.2.0 (annotated)
3. Push: origin main + tag

### npm Publish

Read `npm-packages.json` and publish all 6 packages in `publishOrder` batches:
- Batch 1 (order 1): `@dork-labs/loop-types`
- Batch 2 (order 2): `@dork-labs/loop-sdk`
- Batch 3 (order 3): `@dork-labs/loop-mcp`, `@dork-labs/loop-cli`, `@dork-labs/loop-connect` (parallel)
- Batch 4 (order 4): `@dork-labs/loop-skill`
```

If `--dry-run` flag is present, **STOP** here.

Otherwise, use AskUserQuestion:

```
header: "Confirm Release"
question: "Create release v0.2.0?"
options:
  - label: "Yes, MINOR is correct (Recommended)"
    description: "New features added, backward compatible"
  - label: "No, make it PATCH"
    description: "These are just bug fixes (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)"
  - label: "No, make it MAJOR"
    description: "There are breaking changes (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)"
  - label: "Cancel"
    description: "Abort without making changes"
```

If user overrides the bump type, recalculate version.

---

## Phase 5: Execute Release

### 5.1: Check tag doesn't exist

```bash
git tag -l "v0.2.0"
```

If tag exists, **STOP**:

```
## Cannot Release: Tag Already Exists

Tag v0.2.0 already exists. Choose a different version or delete:
- `git tag -d v0.2.0 && git push origin :refs/tags/v0.2.0`
```

### 5.2: Update VERSION File

```bash
printf "0.2.0" > VERSION
```

### 5.3: Sync Version to package.json Files

Read `npm-packages.json` and update the version for every listed package plus the root. The `directory` field in each entry identifies the `package.json` to update — do not hardcode package names here:

```bash
# Update all published npm packages (read from npm-packages.json)
pnpm version 0.2.0 --no-git-tag-version --filter @dork-labs/loop-types
pnpm version 0.2.0 --no-git-tag-version --filter @dork-labs/loop-sdk
pnpm version 0.2.0 --no-git-tag-version --filter @dork-labs/loop-mcp
pnpm version 0.2.0 --no-git-tag-version --filter @dork-labs/loop-cli
pnpm version 0.2.0 --no-git-tag-version --filter @dork-labs/loop-connect
pnpm version 0.2.0 --no-git-tag-version --filter @dork-labs/loop-skill

# Update root package.json
pnpm version 0.2.0 --no-git-tag-version
```

This updates all published `package.json` files, root `package.json`, and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

### 5.4: Update Changelog

Edit `CHANGELOG.md` using the Edit tool:

1. Replace the `## [Unreleased]` section with a fresh empty one
2. Insert the new version section with today's date
3. Move all previous [Unreleased] content under the new version

**Target structure:**

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-16

[Previous [Unreleased] content here]
```

### 5.5: Sync Changelog to Docs

Update `docs/changelog.mdx` to match `CHANGELOG.md`. Use the Edit tool to replace the content of `docs/changelog.mdx`, keeping the frontmatter and intro line but replacing all version sections.

The sync should:

1. Read the updated `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Extract everything after the `## [Unreleased]` empty section (skip the Unreleased heading and its empty subsections)
3. Strip the link reference definitions at the bottom (lines like `[Unreleased]: https://...`)
4. Write to `docs/changelog.mdx` preserving this structure:

```markdown
---
title: Changelog
description: All notable changes to Loop, following Keep a Changelog format and Semantic Versioning.
---

All notable changes to Loop are documented here. This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

[released content here...]

## [0.1.0] - 2025-02-08

[previous releases...]
```

### 5.5b: Scaffold Blog Post

Create a blog post for this release at `blog/loop-X-Y-Z.mdx` (replace dots with hyphens in the version). Use the changelog content and release theme to populate it:

```markdown
---
title: Loop X.Y.Z
description: [Theme sentence from CHANGELOG.md blockquote, or generated 1-sentence summary]
date: [today's date YYYY-MM-DD]
author: Loop Team
category: release
tags: [release, plus 2-3 relevant tags from the changes]
---

[Theme paragraph — 1-2 sentences describing the release focus]

## Highlights

[2-3 most significant changes with brief explanations]

## All Changes

[Copy from CHANGELOG.md version section — same content as GitHub Release]

## Install / Update

\`\`\`
npm install -g loop@X.Y.Z
\`\`\`
```

The user can edit this post before the release commit. Add the blog post file to the git staging in Phase 5.6.

### 5.6: Commit and Tag

```bash
# Stage all version-related changes (all published packages from npm-packages.json + root)
git add VERSION CHANGELOG.md docs/changelog.mdx \
  packages/types/package.json packages/sdk/package.json \
  packages/mcp/package.json apps/cli/package.json \
  packages/loop-connect/package.json packages/loop-skill/package.json \
  package.json pnpm-lock.yaml blog/

# Commit (use HEREDOC for message)
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(release): v0.2.0

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
```

### 5.7: Push to Origin

```bash
# Push commit and tag
git push origin main && git push origin v0.2.0
```

If push fails, report error and provide recovery commands.

### 5.8: Publish to npm

Ask using AskUserQuestion:

```
header: "npm Publish"
question: "Publish loop v0.2.0 to npm?"
options:
  - label: "Yes, publish to npm (Recommended)"
    description: "Runs pnpm publish --filter @dork-labs/loop-cli to publish the loop package"
  - label: "No, skip pnpm publish"
    description: "Tag is pushed, but package is not published to npm"
```

If yes, first run the npm audit pre-flight, then publish in manifest order:

**Pre-flight:** Run `/npm:audit` to verify all packages pass compliance checks. If any package fails required-field checks, report the failures and ask whether to continue or fix first.

**Publish in `publishOrder` batches** (read from `npm-packages.json`):

```bash
# Batch 1 — publishOrder: 1 (no npm dependencies)
pnpm publish --filter @dork-labs/loop-types --access public

# Batch 2 — publishOrder: 2 (depends on types)
pnpm publish --filter @dork-labs/loop-sdk --access public

# Batch 3 — publishOrder: 3 (can publish in parallel)
pnpm publish --filter @dork-labs/loop-mcp --filter @dork-labs/loop-cli --filter @dork-labs/loop-connect --access public

# Batch 4 — publishOrder: 4 (depends on sdk)
pnpm publish --filter @dork-labs/loop-skill --access public
```

Wait for each batch to complete before starting the next. Each package's `prepublishOnly` hook will build automatically before publishing.

If any package fails to publish, report the error and allow retrying individual packages.

### 5.9: GitHub Release Notes

**Reference**: Use the `writing-changelogs` skill for guidance on writing user-friendly release notes.

Ask using AskUserQuestion:

```
header: "GitHub Release"
question: "Create a GitHub Release?"
options:
  - label: "Yes, create GitHub Release (Recommended)"
    description: "Creates a release on GitHub with narrative release notes"
  - label: "No, skip"
    description: "Tag is pushed, but no GitHub Release created"
```

If yes, generate **narrative release notes** with a fresh theme and highlights, but copy "All Changes" verbatim from CHANGELOG.md:

#### Source for "All Changes"

Read the released version section from `CHANGELOG.md` (the `## [0.2.0]` section just created in Phase 5.4). Copy the bullet entries under each subsection (`### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, etc.) **exactly as written** — do NOT rewrite, regenerate, or summarize them. The changelog entries were already reviewed and approved earlier in this process.

#### Release Notes Template

```markdown
## What's New in v0.2.0

[1-2 sentence theme describing the focus of this release — generate fresh]

### Highlights

[emoji] **[Feature Name]** - [One sentence explaining the benefit and how to use it — generate fresh, 2-3 highlights for most significant changes]

[emoji] **[Feature Name]** - [One sentence explaining the benefit and how to use it — generate fresh]

### All Changes

[COPY verbatim from CHANGELOG.md — do NOT regenerate or rewrite these entries]

### Install / Update
```

npm update -g loop

```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/[owner]/loop/compare/v[prev]...v[new]
```

**Important**: The Theme and Highlights sections above are written fresh (narrative, engaging). The "All Changes" section is copied directly from CHANGELOG.md without modification.

#### Pre-Release Checklist

For the overall release:

- [ ] Has a theme sentence summarizing the release focus
- [ ] 2-3 highlights for significant changes
- [ ] "All Changes" is copied verbatim from CHANGELOG.md (not regenerated)
- [ ] Link to full changelog
- [ ] Install/update instructions included

#### Emoji Reference

| Emoji  | Use For             |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| star   | Major new feature   |
| art    | UI/UX, themes       |
| folder | File handling       |
| wrench | Fixes, improvements |
| zap    | Performance         |
| lock   | Security            |

#### Create the Release

```bash
gh release create v0.2.0 --title "v0.2.0" --notes "[narrative release notes]"
```

## Edge Cases

### Push Fails

```
## Push Failed

The commit and tag were created locally but could not be pushed.
Error: [error message]

To retry:
- `git push origin main`
- `git push origin v0.2.0`

To undo local changes:
- `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
- `git tag -d v0.2.0`
```

### npm Publish Fails

```
## npm Publish Failed

The git tag was pushed but pnpm publish failed for [package].
Error: [error message]

To retry individual packages:
- `pnpm publish --filter @dork-labs/loop-types --access public`
- `pnpm publish --filter @dork-labs/loop-sdk --access public`
- etc.

Common fixes:
- `npm login` (if auth expired)
- Check npm token: `npm whoami`
- Ensure packages publish in order (types → sdk → mcp/cli/connect → loop-skill)
```

### No GitHub CLI

```
## GitHub CLI Not Available

Install GitHub CLI to create releases:
- macOS: `brew install gh`
- Then: `gh auth login`

Or create the release manually at:
https://github.com/[owner]/loop/releases/new?tag=v0.2.0
```

## Related Commands

- `/changelog:backfill` - Populate [Unreleased] from commits since last tag

## When to Use

- After completing a set of features (minor release)
- After fixing bugs (patch release)
- Before breaking changes (major release)
- At natural milestones (sprint end, before sharing)

**Do NOT release on every commit** - releases represent meaningful milestones.
