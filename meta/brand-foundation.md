# DorkOS — Brand & Product Foundation

## 1. Executive Summary

**DorkOS** is an autonomous agent operating system for developers, founders, and serious builders.

It transforms Claude Code into an autonomous agent system — with a heartbeat that works while you sleep, a knowledge vault that remembers everything, and a mesh that lets agents discover and talk to each other.

DorkOS is:

- Open source
- Developer-first
- Radically honest
- Modular
- Extremely powerful

It is not a toy.
It is not a chatbot wrapper.
It is an autonomous agent operating system for people who build.

## 3. Big Idea

Your AI never sleeps.

DorkOS turns Claude Code into:

- Your autonomous engineering team
- Your always-running agent system
- Your persistent knowledge infrastructure
- Your extensible AI operating layer

Your agents.
Your heartbeat.
Your mesh.
Your rules.

---

## 4. Product Architecture

DorkOS is modular and open source. Each module can run independently or together.

### Available now

#### 4.1 DorkOS Core (AI Server)

- Runs locally on your machine
- Wraps Claude Code CLI
- Exposes a secure REST API
- Enables remote access via tunnel
- Unrestricted permissions by design

This is the engine.

**Status: Available**

#### 4.2 DorkOS Console (Web UI)

- Browser-based interface
- Connect to your local Claude instance from anywhere
- Remote dev workflow
- Multi-project support

This makes DorkOS location-independent.

**Status: Available**

### On the roadmap

#### 4.3 DorkOS Pulse (Heartbeat System)

- Autonomous execution loop
- Can run per-project or system-wide
- Executes roadmap improvements
- Solicits user feedback
- Self-building software capabilities

This is what makes DorkOS alive.

**Status: Coming Soon**

#### 4.4 DorkOS Channels (Integration Layer)

- SMS
- Email
- Telegram
- Twitter
- External integrations

Enables AI to communicate outward.

**Status: Coming Soon**

#### 4.5 DorkOS Vault (Knowledge Layer)

Structured knowledge layer built on Obsidian.

- Projects
- People
- Memory
- Strategic planning
- Life systems

Acts as:

- Long-term memory
- Instruction layer
- Context repository

This powers Life Infrastructure workflows.

**Status: Coming Soon**

#### 4.6 DorkOS Mesh (Agent Network)

The nervous system. Turns isolated Claude instances into a coordinated network.

- Folders as agents: each project is its own agent with its own rules, hooks, skills, and memories
- Agent directory: a registry that makes agents aware of each other
- Agent-to-agent communication: structured message passing between agents
- Cross-domain coordination: your scheduling agent notifies your relationship agent about a birthday; your relationship agent asks your finance agent for a budget; your finance agent tells your purchasing agent to buy a gift

The Mesh is what makes DorkOS an operating system, not just a runtime. Without it, you have isolated agents. With it, you have a workforce.

**Status: Coming Soon**

## 5. We Believe

- Your AI should work autonomously on your behalf
- Power tools deserve power users
- Open source is infrastructure, not charity
- Autonomy is a feature, not a risk
- Honesty builds trust — we tell you exactly what runs where

DorkOS is:

- Opinionated
- Performance-focused
- Developer-centric
- Built for serious work
- Radically transparent

---

## 6. What DorkOS Is Not

DorkOS is not a hosted service. Not a model aggregator. Not a chat widget. It's an autonomous agent system you run, configure, and control.

**Honesty note:** Claude Code uses Anthropic's API for inference. Your code context is sent to their servers. DorkOS doesn't change that and won't pretend it does. What DorkOS controls: the agent runs on your machine, sessions are stored locally, tools execute in your shell, and the orchestration layer is entirely yours.

---

## 7. Tone & Voice

Confident.
Minimal.
Technical.
Sharp.
Honest.
Not corporate.

Avoid hype language.

Use language like:

- Autonomous
- Heartbeat
- Orchestration
- Agents
- Permissions
- Control
- Operator
- Builder
