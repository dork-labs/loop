# Build in public

It might feel dangerous to show what you’re building but often it’s more useful. If anything, your competition might be discouraged by your speed and either forced to copy you or avoid copying you.

For you and the team, it reminds you every week what happened and encourages you to ship constantly. For users, it shows the product is getting better. For investors, it shows progress. At times, when you feel things not moving as fast, you can look back at how much you achieved already.
